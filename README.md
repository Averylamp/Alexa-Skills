## MIT Skills

#### MIT People (Live)

MIT People gives the ability to the MIT Community to be more connected. Simply and easily look up any people and their information in the MIT Community.

To find someone, say *find* then the person's name. 
If the skill is not able to narrow it down to one person, say
confirm, then the person's full name. It will then try to match with the closest name. 

After a person is confirmed, the skill will list the types of information available in the database (ex. phone, email, kerberos, department). Simply say what type of information is wanted, or all to list all information.

**Tips and Tricks**
• Say a person's first name (or last name), "find Avery", then after multiple options are said, confirm both first and last name.
• Say a person's first name and last name initial.
• Say just a person's last name
• Try to say the less difficult first or last name to initiate the search, then narrow down with a confirm phrase.
• The skill uses fuzzy matching, so saying a similar name may or may not match


#### MIT Courses (Live)

Ask MIT Courses about any MIT Classes. Please make sure to use the format number point number, specifically stating any zeros. 
MIT Courses can also tell you the instructors for a course, a longer description of the course, or the number of units a course takes up.


#### MIT Dining (Live)

MIT Dining allows you to have up to date information on what is in the dining halls for the day. Simply look up the dining hall information you want by saying 'What is in Baker today" or specify the meal as well by saying "What is in Baker for dinner today".

*Currently only supports the day you ask, but will be soon expanded allowing you to specify which day*
